      title: "About us"
      block_1: "The Indian café BALU is located in the historic center of Kiev, on Velyka Zhytomyrska Street - near the Landscape Alley park, right at the crossroads of the main walking routes. People come here for the proper Indian food by the Indian chef, as well as for the signature cocktails that perfectly complement our spicy dishes."
      block_2: "The history of BALU is closely related to that of another Indian restaurant, HIMALAYA, that first opened in Kyiv back in 1997. More than twenty years later, the son of the owners of HIMALAYA, Yashwi Tripathi, decided to open another Indian restaurant, that would be more youthful, more democratic, but just as authentic as its 'big brother'. Thus, in 2018, the Indian café BALU was opened."
